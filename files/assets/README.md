# Cytus Assets Folder

Place extracted assets in their respective folders here so they can be
grouped by their respective songs in the chart folder. I'm not adding them
directly to the repository since:

1. They're huge (the songs are ~6GB `.wav` files)
2. I don't want a DMCA strike from Rayark

Make sure the file names for the backgrounds, charts, etc. match the chart
IDs in `song_pack_data.json` and `expansion_pack_data.json`, otherwise they
will not be organized (e.g. files related to Body Talk [Chart ID:
`paff001_000`] must be named `paff001_000.png`, `paff001_000.mp3`, etc.).
