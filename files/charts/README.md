# Song Chart Folder

Place the charts here. Make sure to include **all** difficulties, or else they
will be skipped by the file organizer.

If you have the charts, but they look like a garbled mess, that means the charts
are still encrypted. Visit [this gist](https://gist.github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/84bda48aa565c6214d1803a49fd6f5b7)
on how to decrypt Cytus 2 charts. Use `.txt` as the extension instead of `.json`.
